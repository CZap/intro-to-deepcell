This material is designed to cover three specific areas: Unix and Python Basics, Image Analysis in Python, Introduction to Deep Learning and Overview of DeepCell.

## Material

This repo currently holds:

* A tutorial on basic Python/Numpy/Scipy meant to prepare students for more in-depth image analysis work.

You can follow the iPython notebook on github or clone and execute it locally.
Some of these notebooks and tutorials build on and include material from earlier work by Volodymyr Kuleshov and Isaac Caswell on the CS231n Python tutorial by Justin Johnson (http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/).
