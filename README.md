# Introduction to DeepCell through Interactive Tutorials

This material is designed to cover three specific areas: Unix and Python Basics, Image Analysis in Python, Introduction to Deep Learning and Overview of DeepCell.

## Material

This repo currently holds:

* A tutorial on basic Python/Numpy/Scipy meant to prepare students for more in-depth image analysis work.

You can follow the iPython notebook on github or clone and execute it locally.

<sub>These notebooks and tutorials build on and include material from earlier work: 
The basic Python tutorial (including numpy and matplotlib) comes largely from work by Volodymyr Kuleshov and Isaac Caswell on the CS231n Python tutorial by Justin Johnson (http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/).
The Flow statement and SciPy sections come largely from work by Rajath Kumar which is available at https://github.com/rajathkumarmp/Python-Lectures. Those original notes, in turn, were updated for Python 3 and amended for use in Monash University mathematics courses by Andreas Ernst (those are available here: https://gitlab.erc.monash.edu.au/andrease/Python4Maths/tree/master).</sub>
